# Electric-wheelchair

This branch is made by Cunhui Hu 2986514H

This is Team 4. The project is an electric wheelchair. It not only can help the elderly move but also can help them stand up. The elderly have some mobility problems. As you can imagine, the elderly cannot easily stand up when they are sitting, so our team came up with this project. Additionally, it also has an ECG detection function. When the ECG connected to the elderly is detected abnormal, the buzzer will sound an alarm, which can draw the attention of people around. These are its main functions. Other additional functions can be added later. Furthermore, this project has a specific structure that helps to stand up. You can control the motor through the button, and then the motor drives the gear to rotate. The gear is fully coupled to the rack, so the gear pushes the rack up, which tilts the cushion to help the elderly stand up. All in all, it is an electric wheelchair that can help the elderly stand up and provide protection for their safety.
